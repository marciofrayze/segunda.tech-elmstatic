Iâ€™m trying to release a version of my new game (Touch me When) for Android, but since Iâ€™m an individual developer, Google imposes a more strict verification process before allowing me to publish a new App.

They require a 14 days period of closed beta testing with at least 20 testers. Can you help me with that? All you gotta do is download the closed beta version and open it from time to time (like once a day) to count as active user.

To become a tester, all you need to do is join a Google group (they use this as a way to control who can download the App, so it must be with the same email you use on your Android account) at: [https://groups.google.com/g/touchmewhen-testers](https://groups.google.com/g/touchmewhen-testers).

And then you should be able to download the App at: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tech.segunda.touchwhen](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tech.segunda.touchwhen).

Thanks a lot for your help! ðŸ˜„
