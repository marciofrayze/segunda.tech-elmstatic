I am excited to announce the release of my first mobile game built entirely with [Elm](https://elm-lang.org) (and ported to mobile using [Tauri](https://tauri.app) v2 beta)!

This game is a (very simple) fast-paced two-player challenge designed for local play on the same device. Players race to tap the screen when colors and shapes match to score points.

Download it for your iPhone at: https://apps.apple.com/br/app/touch-me-when/id6504830333
