title: "About me"
---

My name is Marcio Frayze David and I am author of the project *segunda.tech*.
  
I've been developing software for over a decade. Since 2009 I have been working as a
systems analyst at the Brazilian Federal Data Processing Service
([SERPRO](https://serpro.gov.br)), where I help several teams to
implement solutions for clients such as the Brazilian Internal Revenue Service 
([Receita Federal](http://receita.economia.gov.br/Receita Federal)) and
the National Traffic Department ([DENATRAN](https://portalservicos.denatran.serpro.gov.br)).
In this company I worked in many solutions, including development of the 
[Digital Traffic Wallet (CDT)](https://servicos.serpro.gov.br/carteira-digital/).  
Although most of my work is developing backend software, I also develop
frontends and mobile apps (for iOS and Android).

## Technologies

### Java
This programming language has been present for most of my career
and I keep studying it and perfecting my skills.

### JavaScript
Main language I use to develop frontends together with
with *Vue.js*, *hypperapp* and *react*.

### Flutter / Kotlin / Swift
I had the opportunity to participate in the development of some mobile applications
using various technologies, the main one being the *framework* 
[Flutter](https://flutter.dev).

### Ruby
In the past I have used this language a lot and even created [a *web framework*](https://github.com/marciofrayze/rackstep) with it.

### Elm
Although I have not used it in any major project, I am a fan of this language
and its community.

### Docker / Kubernetes
I work with DevOps practices, which requires a certain knowledge in this technologies, but
it's a subject I'm still on an intermediate level.

## Interests
I listed just a few of the various technologies I studied throughout
my career, but I've always prioritized the concepts above all else. So,
I pay special attention to the studies of paradigms and good programming practices (clean code).  
For many years my focus was on object-oriented programming, but in
recent years I have also begun to study a lot about the functional paradigm.  
In addition, I am interested in extreme programming and software architecture.

## Studies
I keep up to date through several different sources, including
taking online courses on platforms such as 
[PluralSight](https://pluralsight.com) and [egghead.io](https://egghead.io),
but my favorite source still remains the books. That's why I created
a [podcast](https://segunda.tech/tags/podcast/) to talk only about the 
books that influenced my career.
