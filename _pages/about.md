title: "About me"
---

My name is Marcio Frayze David and I am author of the project *segunda.tech*.
  
I've been developing software for over a decade. Since 2009 I have been working as a
systems analyst at the Brazilian Federal Data Processing Service
([SERPRO](https://serpro.gov.br)), where I help several teams to
implement solutions for clients such as the Brazilian Internal Revenue Service 
([Receita Federal](http://receita.economia.gov.br/Receita Federal)) and
the National Traffic Department ([SENATRAN](https://portalservicos.denatran.serpro.gov.br)).
In this company I worked in many solutions, including development of the 
[Digital Traffic Wallet (CDT)](https://servicos.serpro.gov.br/carteira-digital/).  
Although most of my work is developing backend software, I also develop
frontends and mobile apps (for iOS and Android).

## Technologies

### Java
This programming language has been present for most of my career
and I keep studying it and perfecting my skills.

### JavaScript
Main language I use to develop frontends together with
with *Vue.js*, *hyperapp* and *react*.

### Flutter / Kotlin / Swift
I had the opportunity to participate in the development of some mobile applications
using various technologies, the main one being the *framework* 
[Flutter](https://flutter.dev).

### Clojure
I really like this language and I'm the creator of the course [Clojure: Introduction to Functional Programming](https://segunda.tech/clojure).

### Ruby
In the past I have used this language a lot and even created [a *web framework*](https://github.com/marciofrayze/rackstep) with it.

### Elm
Although I have not used it in any major project, I am a big fan of this language and its community.

### Elixir
I'm still new to this language, but I'm currently studying it through the book <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/phoenix14/programming-phoenix-1-4" target=_blank>Programming Phoenix</a>.

### Haskell
I'm new to this language, but I admire the ideas and conceptions behind it. Studying it has helped me better understand the functional paradigm and have helped me become a better programmer in general.

### Docker / Kubernetes
I work with DevOps practices, which requires a certain knowledge in this technologies, but
it's a subject I'm still on an intermediate level.

## Interests
I listed just a few of the various technologies I studied throughout
my career, but I've always prioritized the concepts above all else. So,
I pay special attention to the studies of paradigms and good programming practices.  
For many years my focus was on object-oriented programming, but in
recent years I have also begun to study a lot about the functional paradigm.  
In addition, I am interested in extreme programming and software architecture.

## Studies
I keep up to date through several different sources, including
taking online courses on platforms such as [Alura](https://alura.com.br), [PluralSight](https://pluralsight.com), [Coursera](https://coursera.org) and [egghead.io](https://egghead.io),
but my favorite source still remains the books. That's why I created
a [podcast](https://segunda.tech/tags/podcast/) to talk only about the 
books that influenced my career. I am also one of the founders of [p de Podcast (p is for Podcast)](https://anchor.fm/pdepodcast/), a podcast (in brazilian portuguese) where we talk about Software Architecture and good programming practices.
